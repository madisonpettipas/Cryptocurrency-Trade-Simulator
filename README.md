# Cryptocurrency-Trade-Simulator
A Java program that simulates a simple cryptocurrency exchange by using heap-based priority queues and a HashMap. This project reflects how crypto exchanges enter, remove, process, match, and modify orders.

## Overview
Buyers and sellers enter orders with a timestamp, price, and quantity. Whenever the highest buy order and the lowest sell order match, a sale is simulated.

The program includes multiple methods for modifying orders and simulating exchanges:
- Enter buy and sell orders
- Display the highest buy order
- Display the lowest sell order
- Compare Priority
        ~ Priority is determined by price, with ties broken by the earliest timestamp.
- Automatically execute buy/sell orders
        ~ Compare the highest buy order to the lowest sell order.
        ~ When they match, or the price of the buy order is greater than the sell order, execute.
        ~ When quantities differ, the remaining quantity is entered back into the heap.
- Change buy and sell orders
- Cancel buy and sell orders

The program accomplishes this by maintaining two heap-based priority queues and a HashMap:
- A MinHeap for sell orders
- A MaxHeap for buy orders
- A HashMap for quicker access to specific orders

## Technologies
- Java
- Heap-Based priority queue and HashMap data structures
